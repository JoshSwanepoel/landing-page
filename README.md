# Landing Page Project

## This project showcases an example landing page for a website

This project was developed using HTML and CSS completely from scratch without using tutorials as aids. The purpose of this project was to test my knowledge of HTML and CSS fundamentals, focusing on Flexbox in particular. This project is part of The Odin Project Foundations course.
